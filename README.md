CS-330-11427-M01

In this rigorous CS-330 course, I did design thoughtfully by first formulating hypotheses—in many cases, algorithms or requirements—and then testing these hypotheses. This would be an iterative approach to keep my design always aligned with the aims of the project.

I was really able to improve my skillset a lot in this project, especially concerning OpenGL. I went from using applications that used OpenGL to coding directly into a library. It was extremely valuable "behind-the-curtain" information to learn and is something I will carry into future graphics projects.

One of the major things I learned from the project is balancing realism and the Requirements. Although I tried to stick to the scene in photographs, I adapted very well into requirements like the addition of a colored lamp.

This iterative development approach used is very important when working on complex projects. Breaking down the final project into small milestones allows focusing on the development and easier debugging that ensures efficient progress and proof-of-concept testing for the different components to be connected at a later phase of development.

All of this aligns perfectly with my pursuit of a deeper understanding in becoming a better project manager. Courses like this one make me understand the difficulties engineers face and let me make informed decisions. The example I have shown here is where I can contribute to discussions on visualization tools, because of this knowledge.

It effectively highlights all the valuable skills and strategies learned from this project in the CS-330 class. This analysis expresses that it is clearly understood how the course has helped me in my development as a project manager.
